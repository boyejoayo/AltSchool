        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups of rice</li>
            <li>1 kg meat (chicken or beef)</li>
            <li>1000 ml ground fresh tomatoes</li>
            <li>50 ml ground fresh peppers</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced onions</li>
            <li>300 ml vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 “fingers” of fresh ginger (grated or ground)</li>
            <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tsp nutmeg powder</li>

            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the meat with salt, one seasoning cube, half the curry and thyme, and half the sliced onions. Let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Boil the meat until tender (about 10–15 min for chicken; longer if beef). Save the stock when done.</li>
            <li>Peel the garlic and ginger; grind or pound them together and set aside.</li>
            <li>Parboil the rice: boil in water for about 3 minutes, then drain and rinse thoroughly. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Deep-fry the cooked meat until crisp; set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same oil (about 300 ml initially), sauté the remaining onions 1–2 min, then add the ground tomato + pepper blend. Fry for ~20 min, stirring frequently until the tomato darkens and oil starts to rise to the top.</li>
            <li>Add the meat stock, the ground ginger/garlic, remaining curry & thyme, nutmeg, salt to taste, another seasoning cube, and about 4 cups of water. Stir and taste such that the mixture should be heavily spiced (the rice will balance it).</li>
            <li>Add the parboiled rice, stir to combine, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook 30–45 min, stirring occasionally, adding water if needed so rice doesn’t burn or stick.</li>
            <li>Once rice is cooked through, fluff gently, then serve hot with the fried meat. Enjoy with plantains, salad or vegetables if desired.</li>

    <!-- Optional Tips / Notes -->

        <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
        <p>
            For extra flavor, allow the bottom layer to caramelize slightly to give the signature smoky “party jollof” taste.  
            If the tomato sauce threatens to burn before rice is added, remove a portion of it and re-add later.  
            You can also adjust the heat by reducing the amount of fresh pepper, or substituting with milder peppers.
